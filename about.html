	<strong> My name is Cormac and I'm the local Muggle Liason Officer for the Bristol area. 
	As your MLO, it's my responsibility to inform you all of certain magical goings-on, and to ensure
	amicable and generous spirit between our two communities. <br/> <br/>

    It was 16 years ago that Malawi won the Quidditch World Cup, in what we know was the most fractious of times. 
	Perhaps it was in the spirit of bringing communities together that the winning captain did something unheard of. 
	He gifted the posts from the final game to the muggle community, and asked the opposing Senegalese captain, Adou Sosseh, 
	to enchant them into place. <br/> <br/>

    The historic act took place outside the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, but it is a history that we're in danger 
	of not recognising. As such, I propose a plaque that will be dedicated to both the children of Bristol, and the magical 
	folk who sought to enchant their imaginations. What better time than now to show our gratitude? Thank you for your generosity! </strong>
